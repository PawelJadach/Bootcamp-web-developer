      <h1>Real For You</h1>
      <i>by James Hersey</i>
      <p>
        I don't know what you came from Don't know what you left behind So don't
        be afraid 'cause <i>I'm not gonna use it against you now</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        I know what you came for 'Cause I know what you like But it don't make
        sense how You could be so
      </p>
      <p>
        You say it's the same to you But I can't shake the feeling off my mind
        That you want more, you want more Something in the way you look Away,
        like you don't need me at your side But you want more, you want more
      </p>
      <p>
        Real for you I can't help it, I get real for you I feel for you When I
        get real for you I can't help it, I get real for you I feel for you
      </p>
